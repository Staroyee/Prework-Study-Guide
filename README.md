# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation to build this webpage was to create a place to store notes for coding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git to be used by the boot camp students.
- This makes it easy for myself and others to access the notes that I have collated.
- Throughout this process I have learned the basics of coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript whilst also getting an understanding of Github, Gitbash and how to use them to commit
the changes to the code I made to my repository and create a webpage.
