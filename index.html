           <ul>
               <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
               <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
               <li>Use the HTML Color Codes website to get the Hexadecimal code to define the desired colour.</li>
               <li>using a . before the class name will designate it as a class selector. Any HTML element
                assigned to that class will gain the property assignments from that CSS.</li>
               <li>A link: element creates the connection to an external file.</li>
               <li>The rel: attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
               <li>The href: attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
               <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration (color: blue;) includes the CSS property (color) and the value for that property, (blue).</li>
               <li>CSS Box Model: consists of a Margin, Border, Padding, and Content. The 'Margin' property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The 'Border' is set between the 'Margin' and the 'Padding'. The 'Padding' property adds space around the content inside an element, increasing the 'Padding' makes the entire element bigger.</li>
