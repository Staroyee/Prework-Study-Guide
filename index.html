            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The "title" element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
            <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>

               <li>The period preceding "card" designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, "card", will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
               <li>The first declaration addresses the "width" of the element at 80% of the available "width".</li>
               <li>A "margin" indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
               <li>The "border" property assigns a "border" with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
               <li>A "padding" indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
               <li>The "box-shadow" CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
               <li>Use the HTML Color Codes website to get the Hexadecimal code to define the desired colour.</li>
               <li>using a . before the class name will designate it as a class selector. Any HTML element
                assigned to that class will gain the property assignments from that CSS.</li>
               <li>A link: element creates the connection to an external file.</li>
               <li>The rel: attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
               <li>The href: attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
               <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration (color: blue;) includes the CSS property (color) and the value for that property, (blue).</li>
               <li>CSS Box Model: consists of a Margin, Border, Padding, and Content. The 'Margin' property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The 'Border' is set between the 'Margin' and the 'Padding'. The 'Padding' property adds space around the content inside an element, increasing the 'Padding' makes the entire element bigger.</li>

             <li>the "script.js" file is linked within the "body" element.</li> 
             <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the "var" keyword.</li>
             <li>After the "var" keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
             <li>Finally, we use an assignment operator "=" to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
             <li>console.log is the index number</li>
             <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
             <li>We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length.</li>
             <li>a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
             <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword</li>
             <li>Use "else" to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
             <li>Use "else if" to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>

             <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
             <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
             <li>JavaScript reads the code from top to bottom.</li>
             <li>The Math namespace object contains static properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.</li>
